## Features

### Terminal

- **Mouse mode** — vertical swipes send SGR scroll events to TUI apps (vim, zellij, htop)
- **Keyboard toolbar** — Esc, Tab, Ctrl, Alt, arrow keys, and common shell symbols (| ~ / -)
- **Text selection** — long-press to select with word expansion, d-pad anchor adjustment, copy, and Open URL button
- Configurable font size (8–32 sp)
- 6 color schemes: Haven, Classic Green, Light, Solarized Dark, Dracula, Monokai

### OSC Sequences

Remote programs can interact with Android through standard terminal escape sequences:

| OSC | Function | Example |
|-----|----------|---------|
| 52 | Set clipboard | `printf '\e]52;c;%s\a' "$(echo -n text \| base64)"` |
| 8 | Hyperlinks | `printf '\e]8;;https://example.com\aClick\e]8;;\a'` |
| 9 | Notification | `printf '\e]9;Build complete\a'` |
| 777 | Notification (with title) | `printf '\e]777;notify;CI;Pipeline green\a'` |
| 7 | Working directory | `printf '\e]7;file:///home/user\a'` |

Notifications appear as a toast when Haven is in the foreground, or as an Android notification when in the background. Unrecognised OSC numbers (0, 4, 10, etc.) pass through to the emulator.

### Reticulum

- Connect over [rnsh](https://github.com/acehoss/rnsh) via Sideband or direct TCP gateway
- **Announce-based discovery** — auto-discovers rnsh destinations on the Reticulum network with hop count
- Periodic refresh of discovered destinations
- Multi-tab support (same as SSH)

### SFTP File Browser

- Browse remote directories with navigation and back button
- Upload files from device, download to device, delete, copy path
- Toggle hidden files, sort by name/size/date

### SSH Key Management

- Keys stored encrypted in local storage

### Connections
